## what are we doing
### The problem
+ There is a huge surge of information on COVID-19. this makes it hard for scientists to easily surf the papers
+ There is a need for more open scientific research practices not only in Africa but beyond

### The solution
+ Develop a tool for easier searches and visibility of covid-19 pre-prints and post-prints in Immunology
+ Influence beneficial experiences through our tool and thereby encourage an open culture in other science fields practicing a closed approach of communication
+ start a space that connects the research community to open science communication initiatives for sharing, collaboration, and promotion of open science practice.

## Who are we
We are ols-2 project leads ( Jelioth Muthoni, Brenda Muthoni and Hariet Natabona) working under the mentorship of Naomi Penfold to create and leverage on a COVID-19 database for immunology and promote awareness of open science communication

## what do we need 
 > you!!! in whatever way you can help. 
 We need contributors who can review our progress and make comments or give feedback in our steps of developing a database and 
 Expertise in database design and maintainance.
 > with the aim of encouraging open science communication we hope that you could visit our database once it exixts.
